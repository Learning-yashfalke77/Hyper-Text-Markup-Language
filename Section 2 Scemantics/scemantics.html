        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
            According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the
            Classical
            Latin India, a reference to
            South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek
            India (
            Ἰνδία); ancient Greek
            Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its
            cognate,

            evolved.[69][70][71] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years
            ago.[72]

            The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural
