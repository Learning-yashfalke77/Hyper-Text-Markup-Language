    <h1>India</h1>
    <p>
        <b>India</b> (Hindi: Bhārat), officially the <b>Republic of India</b> (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[23] is a
        country in South Asia. It is the
        second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy">democracy</a> in the
        world. Bounded by the Indian
        Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land
        borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China,
        Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the
        vicinity of Sri Lanka and the
        Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
        According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the Classical
        Latin India, a reference to
        South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India (
        Ἰνδία); ancient Greek
        Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate,
        the Sanskrit Sindhu, or
        "river," specifically the Indus river and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[60][61] The ancient
        Greeks referred to the
        Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as "The people of the Indus".[62] The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced
        [ˈbʱaːɾət]
        (About this soundlisten)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[63][64] is used
        in its variations by many
        Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to a region
        of the Gangetic Valley
        ,[65][66] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[63][67]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Ancient India</h3>
    <p>
        By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from
        Africa, where they had earlier
        evolved.[69][70][71] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[72]
        After 6500 BCE, evidence
        for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural
        surplus appeared in Mehrgarh
        and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[73]

    <h3>Medival India</h3>
    <p>
        The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[100]
        When Harsha of Kannauj,
        who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by
        the Chalukya ruler of
        the Deccan.[101] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of
        Bengal.[101] When the Chalukyas
        attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed
        by the Pandyas and the
        Cholas from still farther south.[101]
    </p>
    <h3>Mordern India</h3>
    <p>
        Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of
        Lord Dalhousie as Governor
        General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the
        consolidation and demarcation
        of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among
        them, railways, canals,
        and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[131][132][133][134] However,
        disaffection with the company
        also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
